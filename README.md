# csc_4240
Programming assignments from my undergraduate Artificial Intelligence course.

I wrote these back my first semester Junior year (Fall 2014), and they might not exibit the best programming practices.

eight_puzzle is written in Prolog and requires an interperter.

The other three are C++ projects. neural_net has a makefile and a short readme. 
The others are simply built with `g++ -O2 -std=c++11 -o program *.cpp` or something similar.
